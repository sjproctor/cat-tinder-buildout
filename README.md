# Cat Tinder Project for LEARN Academy

A weeklong project for students to explore a decoupled application using React and Ruby on Rails.

**Student User Story**  
As a developer, I have been commissioned to create an application where a user can see cute cats looking for friends. As a user, I can see a list of cats. I can click on a cat and see more information about that cat. I can also add cats to the list of cats looking for friends. If my work is acceptable to my client, I may also be asked to add the ability to remove a cat from the list as well as edit cat information.

### Cat Tinder Buildout
Each section has the code built out for that particular section. Topic user stories and process notes are in the individual README of each project.
